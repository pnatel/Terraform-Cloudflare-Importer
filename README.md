# Terraform-Cloudflare-Importer

This script will generate terraform files for all possibly Cloudflare
settings for supported resources, and import (most of them) in the Terraform
state file. More details in:
https://developers.cloudflare.com/terraform/advanced-topics/import-cloudflare-resources

The script uses a list of Version 4 resources extracted from: (From Mar/2025)
https://github.com/cloudflare/cf-terraforming?tab=readme-ov-file#supported-resources

## HOW TO USE IT

1. Clone this repo
2. Create the .env file with the following variables:
   ```
   CLOUDFLARE_EMAIL=email@domain.tld
   TF_VAR_API_TOKEN=XXXXXXXXXXXX  # This is the Clouflare API token
   ACCOUNT=XXXXXXXX
   ZONE01=XXXXXX
   ZONE02=xxxxx
   SIMULATION=True
   ```

> PS: The number of zones is added/removed manually. Change it as necessary.
>
> PS2: Keep `SIMULATION=True` in the first run to confirm the script will output the commands as expected.

3. Update the Cloudflare version in the `provider.tf` (This script works with version's 4 and 5 of Cloudflare).
4. (FOR CLOUDFLARE VERSION 4 ONLY) Check/update resource-types.csv table using the list of resources available in:
   https://github.com/cloudflare/cf-terraforming?tab=readme-ov-file#supported-resources
5. Execute run.sh

## TODO
- simulation mode is not usefull anymore. It would be better to replace it with a sample step instead (at least for the generation part)
